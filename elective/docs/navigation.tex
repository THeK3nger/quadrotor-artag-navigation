\subsection{The navigation problem}

Now that our quadrotor know how to do hovering on a single tag, it is time to
add more tags to make possible for it to follow a path.

The quadrotor maintains a list of the existent tags and a pointer (usually an
integer index) to the current active tag. At any time we can order a change of quadrotor active tag 
and see it move towards the selected new active one.

In our simulation we use a simple sequential path: the robot can follow only
one direction, forward or backward. In general more complex path can be created
(i.g. a tree-like path). The only limitation is that the quadrotor
